Fix users to work with bootstrap
Fix users to return password
Add edit user tap w/ dropdown for user select
Auto populate user data on selection
Allow edit user data
On form submit for newly created user, send them to the edit user screen with data (most importantly password, coppied)
Add a copy password for me text thingy cause that would be useful as hell

why doesnt jquery just get compiled before depolyment? Just grab the functions you need if overhead is too high.
Is it because the functions are slow or badly implemented or is it because they overhead of loading the whole library?
